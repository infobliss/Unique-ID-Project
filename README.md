# Unique-ID-Project
The origin of this lies in UID project of GoI, where a central server can be accessed to determine whether some information on an individual is correct or not, but without divulging the information itself. For instance, the database will help determine whether a given person's DoB is xxx or not, but without the database server itself volunteering such information.
